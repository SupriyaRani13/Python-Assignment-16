Pyhton Assignment - 16

1. Create a list called years_list, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until
the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be years_list =
[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985].

Sol: Eg - years_list = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005]
          print(years_list)

  We can replace the starting year (2000) with your desired birth year, and the ending year (2005) with the year of your fifth birthday, 
  to create the list you need.

2. In which year in years_list was your third birthday? Remember, you were 0 years of age for your
   first year.

Sol:If you were 24 years of age for your first year, then your third birthday would have occurred when you were 24 + 2 = 26 years old.
   Let's assume your birth year is 2000. In that case, your third birthday would have been in the year:-

  2000 + 26 = 2026

So, in the year 2026, you would have celebrated your third birthday.

Please adjust the calculations based on your actual birth year if needed.


3.In the years list, which year were you the oldest?

Sol: If you were 24 years of age for your first year and the list starts from your birth year, then the year in which you would be the oldest in the years_list can be calculated by adding your age to each subsequent year and finding the maximum value. Here's an example:-


  Eg - birth_year = 2000
       age_at_birth = 24
       years_list = [birth_year + age_at_birth]

      for i in range(1, 6):
        years_list.append(birth_year + age_at_birth + i)

      oldest_year = max(years_list)
      print("The year you were the oldest:", oldest_year)

  Output:- The year you were the oldest: 2029


4. Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: 'mozzarella', 'cinderella',
   'salmonella';.

Sol: Eg - things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]
          print(things)


    Output- ['mozzarella', 'cinderella', 'salmonella']

5. Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the
   element in the list?

Sol:  I can capitalize the element in the things list that refers to a person and then print the updated list.

     Eg - things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]

      # Capitalize the element that refers to a person
      person_index = 1  # Index of "cinderella"
      things[person_index] = things[person_index].capitalize()

      # Print the updated list
      print(things)

  Output : ['mozzarella', 'Cinderella', 'salmonella']


6. Make a surprise list with the elements 'Groucho',"", 'Chico' and 'Harpo'

Sol: Eg - surprise_list = ['Groucho', '', 'Chico', 'Harpo']
          print(surprise_list)

    Output: ['Groucho', '', 'Chico', 'Harpo']

7. Lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.

Sol: Eg - surprise_list = ['Groucho', '', 'Chico', 'Harpo']

# Lowercase the last element
last_element = surprise_list[-1].lower()

# Reverse the last element
reversed_element = last_element[::-1]

# Capitalize the reversed element
capitalized_reversed_element = reversed_element.capitalize()

# Replace the last element in the list with the modified one
surprise_list[-1] = capitalized_reversed_element

# Print the updated list
print(surprise_list)

Output: ['Groucho', '', 'Chico', 'Oprah']


8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is
   chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse.

Sol:  Eg -  e2f = {
          'dog': 'chien',
          'cat': 'chat',
          'walrus': 'morse'
}

          print(e2f)

Output: {'dog': 'chien', 'cat': 'chat', 'walrus': 'morse'}

The dictionary e2f contains the English words as keys and their corresponding French translations as values.


9. Write the French word for walrus in your three-word dictionary e2f.

Sol: Eg - e2f['walrus']

  Output: 'morse'

10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.

Sol:  Eg - f2e = dict((key,value) for value,key in e2f.items())
           f2e

  Output: {'chat': 'cat', 'chien': 'dog', 'morse': 'walrus'}

11. Print the English version of the French word chien using f2e.

Sol: Eg - f2e['chien']

  Output: 'dog'

12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f.

Sol:  Eg - e2f.keys()

   Output: dict_keys(['dog', 'cat', 'walrus'])

13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: 'animals', 'plants', and 'other'. Make the 'animals' key refer to another dictionary with the keys 'cats', 'octopi', and 'emus'. Make the 'cats' key refer to a list of strings with the values 'Henri', 'Grumpy', and 'Lucy'. Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.

Sol: Eg - life ={'animals':{'cat':['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'], 'octopi':'', 'emus':''},
       'plants' :'',
       'other' :'' }
     life

Output: {'animals': {'cat': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'], 'emus': '', 'octopi': ''},
 'other': '',
 'plants': ''}

14. Print the top-level keys of life.

Sol:  Eg - life.keys()

    Output: dict_keys(['animals', 'plants', 'other'])


15.  Print the keys for life['animals'].

Sol: Eg - life['animals'].keys()

   Output: dict_keys(['cat', 'octopi', 'emus'])


16. Print the values for life['animals']['cat']

  Sol: Eg - life['animals']['cat']

   Output: ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy']
